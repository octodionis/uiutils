Playing around with Uiua

A bunch of functions and algorithms that seemed fun to implement, mostly split into these categories for now:


**Number operations:**
- integer divisors (including self)
- greatest common divisor
- least common multiple
- first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

**Matrix operations:**
- matrix multiplication (with anti inverse for matrix "division")
- matrix determinant (using recursion)
- inverse matrix
- identity matrix of n rank
- zero matrix of n rank
- turn vector into diagonal matrix

**Image manipulation:**
- generate flag based on colours (works with all the built-in pride flags)
- spin (rotate) image clockwise (useful for vertical striped flags)

Also contains a (not by any means comprehensive) list of country flag colours as [two-letter codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
